## Setup

TODO

Clone the repository

```shell
git clone https://github.com/NHSDigital/dtos-service-layer
cd dtos-service-layer
```

### Prerequisites

The following software packages, or their equivalents, are expected to be installed and configured:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) container runtime or a compatible tool, e.g. [Podman](https://podman.io/),
- [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) - .NET 9.0
- [Azure functions core tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?tabs=macos%2Cisolated-process%2Cnode-v4%2Cpython-v2%2Chttp-trigger%2Ccontainer-apps&pivots=programming-language-csharp)
- [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)
- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) 3.82 or later,

> [!NOTE]<br>
> The version of GNU make available by default on macOS is earlier than 3.82. You will need to upgrade it or certain `make` tasks will fail. On macOS, you will need [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed, then to install `make`, like so:
>
> ```shell
> brew install make
> ```
>
> You will then see instructions to fix your [`$PATH`](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_path.tmpl) variable to make the newly installed version available. If you are using [dotfiles](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/dotfiles), this is all done for you.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) required to run Git hooks,
- [`jq`](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/) a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

## Configuration

Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` and populate the missing environment variables which are listed at the top of the file.

### Testing

The full test suite can be ran with `make test`.

Unit tests can be ran with `make test-unit`
